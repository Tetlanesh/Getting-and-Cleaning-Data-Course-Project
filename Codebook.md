# Codebook

This is codebook for file "tidy_data_set.txt" generated by "run_analisys.R" script.

# Structure of the file

##This is a:
 - txt file 
 - with white-space used as column separator
 - with first row containing headers

##File origin
This file is a final form of transformation of initial data set provided by samsung experiments as describek here:
 - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
And available for download in here:
 - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

##File dimensions:
 - 180 rows
 - 68 columns

##Columns:
 - Subject_code - id of a subject performing experiment
 - Activity_description - label of activity containing one of the following values:
   -  WALKING
   -  WALKING_UPSTAIRS
   -  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
   -  SITTING
   -  STANDING
   -  LAYING
 - 66 features columns descrideb more below, containing mean value of respected measurments
 
##Features naming convention

Each of 66 features is based on original samsung data. Name of each feature contain following informations:
 - domain of measurment:
   - time_ - containing measurments of time of action
   - freq_ - containing measurment of frequency of action
 - type of measurment:
   - tBodyAcc
   - tGravityAcc
   - tBodyAccJerk
   - tBodyGyro
   - tBodyGyroJerk
   - tBodyAccMag
   - GravityAccMag
   - BodyAccJerkMag
   - BodyGyroMag
   - BodyGyroJerkMag
   - BodyAc
   - BodyAccJerk
   - BodyGyro
   - BodyAccMag
   - BodyAccJerkMag
   - BodyGyroMag
   - BodyGyroJerkMag
 - function used to transform data
   - _mean - mean of meassurment values
   - _std - standard deviation of meassurments
 - (optional) axis of meassurment
   - _X - meassurment in X axes
   - _Y - meassurment in Y axes
   - _Z - meassurment in Z axes

So for example feature "freq_BodyAcc_std_Z" stands for "standard deviation of frequency of acceleration changes in Z axis"

## File values

Each row, appart from Subject and Activity first two columns contains a mean() value for specified activity by specified subject for each of 66 features
